Recent summary of the team programmers' TeleOp code:

1. A 'complete' version was posted here on Saturday March 5.

2. On Sunday March 6, a 5-page detailed list of constructive comments and suggestions was posted at the 
   team's Google Drive. It should be noted that the code would not compile.  Among other things it was
   missing critical semi-colons, indicating that the latest version was not developed in Android Studio
   or any other Java IDE.

3. On Tuesday March 15, the 'updated version' of the code was posted here, reportedly with substantial
   improvements made during the previous 9 days.  However this latest version, still named "v1",
   is identical to the previous March 6 version, including for example the missing semicolons.
   The explanations listed are: "computer changed some setup files" and "had to recommit, commit conflicts".

4. The github history shows only a March 14 attempt to RENAME (!) the posted file from v1 to v2.
   But there is no evidence of an actual updated file existing on github. Also no activity in the team
   Google Drive, Programming folder.
